After working through it for hours, we still weren't able to get data loaded into Google Analytics. I tried to use both
GA4 and Universal Analytics, but neither was working for me. Additionally, I checked back after a few days to see if anything
had loaded, I noticed that user activity had but no information from the tags loaded.
